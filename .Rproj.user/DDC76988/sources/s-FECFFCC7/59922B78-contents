Welcome! My name is Yumary Vasquez and I am a third year graduate student in the Quantitative and Systems Biology program at UC Merced. I am a computational biologist with an emphasis in evolutionary work. My research interest includes using comparative genomics to study the co-evolution of obligate symbionts and their hosts. I am the President of the graduate student podcast: RadioBio. <br>

I am a graduate student of the [Bennett Lab](http://faculty.ucmerced.edu/gbennett2/index.html) at UC Merced. I am currently studying the co-evolution of the symbionts _Candidatus_ Sulcia muelleri and _Candidatus_ Nasuia deltocephalinicola with their leafhopper hosts. My current research focuses on leafhoppers that are endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago. However, my future research will include using the _Macrosteles quadrilineatus_ leafhopper.
